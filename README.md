# CSE-211_BigInt
This is a project i have done for CSE-211(Data Structures) course in my university education.

# BigInt
I created a big int class to have infinite digits in a number (as long as computer memory allows). BigInt class uses a linked list class, i have written, to store the digits. It will probably be faster with a dynamic array, however this was how our instructer for the course demanded it.

# Test
main.c in the directory uses big int class to find the first given number of digits of PI after the dot.
